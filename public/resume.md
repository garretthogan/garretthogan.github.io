## Selected Projects (Public / Open Source)

### Brush Editor 
https://garretthogan.github.io/brush-editor/

A constructive solid geometry editor for web.

It started as an experiment in procedural generation and rapid prototyping. I split the proc gen features out into their own tool and simplified the brush editor into a standard CSG editor that behaves like Hammer or Unreal Engine.

- Quickly prototype liminal spaces to connect set pieces like arenas, dungeons or interiors.
- Export combined brushes into a single glb or keep them seperate for a WIP flow
- Since it exports to GLB it is very easy to import the brushes into unity. unreal, godot, or other web apps.

Tech: JavaScript, Three JS

### Art Grid  
https://garretthogan.github.io/art-grid/

Procedurally generate abstract art pieces in your browser.

My friend built the stamps and asked if there was a way to generate compositions to rapidly prototype before polish in adobe illustrator. I created the art grid to give them a space to iterate on designs until they found what they liked.

- The design goal was to keep the workspace open and minimal so that the user isn't overwhelmed with options like in illustrator.
- Supports exporting to SVG, PNG or JOEG.
- Optimized workspace never renders the canvas larger than 64x64.
- Dynamically scales vector graphics on export to match desired resolution.

Tech: JavaScript, SVG

### Light Fighter  
https://garretthogan.github.io/light-fighter/

A browser based prototype for a Megabonk/Vamp survivors like top down isometric game

- Flexible spawn factory makes it easy to add new targets.
- Moving targets are highly configurable and scale with difficulty.

Tech: Three JS, JavaScript

### Level Generator  
https://garretthogan.github.io/level-generator/
https://github.com/garretthogan/ULevelGenerator

A rapid prototyping tool to quickly generate arenas, dungeons, and interiors that you can export to GLB.

I built this so that I could easily generate different kinds of game spaces and explore them in first person without the complexity of a full blown game engine.

- Preview levels in the browser using a simple FPS controller
- Use the gallery view to quickly iterate over dozens of levels
- Built a wrapper plugin that bridges my level generator into the Unreal Engine editor

Tech: JavaScript, Three JS, C++, Unreal Engine

### Aim Trainer  
https://garretthogan.github.io/aim-trainer/

A cross platform shooting game built for the browser.

- Real time projectile physics using ammo js
- Adjustable difficulty
- VR support is coming!!

Tech: JavaScript, Three JS, ammo JS

### Blackjack Frontend  
https://garretthogan.github.io/blackjack-frontend/

I am doing balatro to blackjack.

- Roguelike mechanics such as deck builder and shop
- Dealer AI plays according to common vegas casino rules like hitting on a soft 17.

Tech: React, JavaScript

---

### Design System  
https://garretthogan.github.io/design-system/

I am personally inspired by the retro hacker terminal aesthetic and I wanted my personal projects to share a common design theme. I built this to capture my own design tastes and to make it easy to bring that aesthetic into any project that I spin up. This is typically a default dep in any personal project.

- Single css file for easy integration
- Very lightweight and relatively unopinionated.

Tech: CSS, bash for bundling the static site.
